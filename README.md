psmay's Stupid Kotlin Tricks
============================

This is a repository for ideas implemented in Kotlin not because they're particularly useful but because they're fun, funny, interesting, or clever (especially if too clever for their own good).

Current modules
---------------

*   `com.psmay.stupid.options`: `Opt` is a value class that represents either a single value or no value. It's a little weird but easy to use and should involve less overhead than an inheritance-based option type like the one in Arrow.

Notes
-----

Except where necessary for some specific reason, these are implemented in the common variant of Kotlin.

Documentation is a goal that I haven't hit yet.

Setting up some sort of CI for this could be amusing.
